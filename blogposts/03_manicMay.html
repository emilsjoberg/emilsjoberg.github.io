Last month was Manic May. I grew a beard. I was in my room so much I rearranged it. I drank coffee a lot; after work. All were byproducts of a lot of work done in May. I had a lot of what I thought was low hanging fruit, and wanted to pick it all. It was interesting. It was hard. It was a failure. Yet a successful kind of failure. A very good friend started a company. In conversation, he mentioned that even if he is on a road leading to failure, he will have learned more than if he was working for his previous company going through an IPO. I liked how he stayed with that thought long enough to come to that conclusion. Isn’t going through an IPO the ultimate goal? Not as a minion. Google an article titled ‘learn or earn’.
<br><br>
My low hanging fruit included building this site, going through a couple Python books over NLP, stick with a couple Coursera classes, build a D3 superviz and to grind away at my passion project; Scroll. This was too much. I pushed this site live. I got through one book. But Coursera classes were dropped. My D3 superviz never got its cape. The worst, the part of Scroll I wanted in code is still in my head. So Manic May must be a failure? I am unsure. I carefully monitored my daily performance, which I never bothered doing before. This taught me a lesson more valuable than the contents of the dust ridden Python book. I was taught in addition to work I can allow myself two projects. One is not enough. Two provides diversity and requires discipline. Three is when my work suffers. Was this Coursera class propelling me towards my six month goal? No. Although valuable, it was not in that sense. Some tasks had become a horrid version of wasting time reading interesting, yet ultimately worthless, articles on Hacker News. So far this has been Jolly June. Why? Working on two projects has led to the perfect amount of progress. A kernel of thought for readers to think about; the perpetually chased perfect work load.
